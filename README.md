## üöÄ Quick Setup

Follow these steps to get up and running:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KIRAN-KUMAR-K3/GitHub-Follow-Unfollow-Automation.git
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Install the necessary Python libraries:

```bash
pip install requests
```

### 3. Generate Your GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT)

- Go to **GitHub Settings** > **Developer Settings** > **Personal Access Tokens**.
- Generate a new token with **Fine-grained access** and give it the necessary permissions (like repository access and follower management).

### 4. Configure the Script

In `run.py`, update the placeholder with your generated GitHub token:

```python
TOKEN = "your_personal_access_token_here"
```

Also, specify the list of GitHub users you wish to follow:

```python
usernames_to_follow = ["username1", "username2", "username3"]
```

### 5. Run the Script

You‚Äôre now ready to run the script. Use the following commands:

- **Follow users**:

  ```bash
  python follow.py
  ```

- **Unfollow all users**:

  ```bash
  python unfollow.py
  ```

The script handles GitHub API rate limits and resumes operations after waiting for the required cooldown time.

### üñ•Ô∏è Example Output

```
Unfollowing username1... Success
Unfollowing username2... Success
Following username3... Success
